JENKINS:::::2.7
=======================

java based application                                                                    post build setups
why we need jenkins?????used for ci &cd                        builds                                              deploy                         
developer------->git<----------jenkins--------along with some test cases like unit testcase-------->revert back.

STEPS
========
download jenkins from repo--------jenkins.io
place the war file that you get any location of your system
go to cmd promt where jenkins war file generated

generate the paswd and save it at notepad
go to browser and hit       localhost:8080-----------------jenkins webpage'll come
the plugins will installed there we can select the suggested plugins or required plugins or all plugines or none of the plugins,-------just take suggested plugins







SETUP JENKINS ON TOMCAT:::::
========================================
WHY SHOULD WE DEPLOY JENKINS IN TOMCAT??????? 
tomcat is a most common used servlet container----------so we can deploy jenkins in other servlet containers
you can start almost applications on single server------------"      "

PREREQUISIT::
================
tomcat::::8(above 5)
java 7 or above should be available

1....download tomcat 8---binary zip file(core ---1st one)
unzip tomcat folder at /opt
rename that 
copy/place the jenkins war file from jenkins folder and paste it at /tomcat/webapps folder
go to tomcat bin directory--------change the permissions for execution
chmod +x* .sh--------------means executable.
start tomcat---------------./startup.sh-------------to shutdown tomcat ------------./shutdown.sh
ps -ef | grep tomcat
check at browser with localhost:8080
localhost:8080/jenkins
username & passwd
so jenkins is running inside tomcat folder,not running as a standalone jenkins
here tomcat is running in 8080 and jenkins also run in same port 8080 bydefault so we should give other port no like 9090------------>standalone server can't run the 
same port.





CHANGING THE JENKINS HOME DIRECTORY:::::
========================================
when ever we installed the jenkins by default there will be create one folder like .jenkins at user profile.
it contains all the information about the logs,plugins,configurations and total build information.at jenkins home directory-----------move jenkins to 
other directory-------------reason for change the home directory is for enough disk space-----because all plugins added and fs need to be spacious. and also common 
reason is for requirement of project

1...check our current home directory
      go to MANAGE JENKINS
	        CONFIGURE SYSTEM
there we can see the home directory

2.create a new folder which will be new home directory
3.copy all old directory to new directory
4.change env variable ------JENKINS_HOME and set to new directory
export:JENKINS_HOME=/user profilepath/jenkinshome
5.we have to restart jenkins
ctrl+c--------and again we can start the jenkins.
(or)
at browser------------localhost:8080/restart------
and logs will come there at logs



MANAGE JENKINS
CONFIGURE SYSTEM---------------------there we can see the home dir path------------still it doesn't change.
because we have set it done for env variables for temporary session so we need save env vars as perminent,so enter at .bash_profiles.
export:JENKINS_HOME=/user profilepath/jenkinshome    and svae
go to jenkins.war file and start the jenkins.
check at browser




JENKINS AT CLI::::::
====================
WHY SHOUL I MOVE TO CMD LINE??????????IF I HAVE GUI?
easier
faster and more convinent
memory management
more efficient when compared to  gui of memory consuming.
when you are doing contineous integration and build process we have to do from cmd line.
to start jenkins--------java -jar jenkins.war---macos

MANAGE JENKINS
CONFIGURE GLOBAL SECURITY
check enable security-------------apply and save
goto browser localhost:8080/cli
download jar file
