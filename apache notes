creation of file:
==================
touch filename
vi filename
cat >filename
echo "content" >filename

chmod 700 file/directory
chown -R user:group filename/directory



when we wre moving the file first we need take backup then move
server to server copy file
=============================
scp filename userid@destination server:/path


soft link:
====================
it has diff inodes
ls -l cmd shows all links wt second colum value and this link points to original file
remove the soft link does not effect the anything
bt when the original file is removed the link become as a dangling link that points none existent file
soft link can link to a directory


hard link:
=====================
have same i nones numbers
ls -l cmd shows the link no.of links
links hav actual file content
removing any link just it reduces the count doesn't affect the other links
you can't create a hard link to the directoeis
	if the original file is removed still it shows the the content of the file 
	
	
	
httpd internal files and directories               to find the file/directory ---------   find / -name filename
=====================================
cd /etc/httpd
             :  conf
                conf.d
                conf.modules.d
                logs -> ../../var/log/httpd
                modules -> ../../usr/lib64/httpd/modules
                run -> /run/httpd

	
	
	
to check the services in windows:
======================================
run------>services.msc----------all services are here-----------we can start/stop/restart here
to check the services at linux:
======================================
ps -ef / grep  




	
flow of apache?
========================
end user request will come to port----------- 80-----------apache-------httpd.conf-------document root---------/var/www/html------directory index----
index.html------errorlog,accesslog.



what is the proxy/reverse proxy:
=========================
it is a intermediate server
who passs the request and who takess the request and pass the request to backend components and take the response from backend componenets and give 
it to back.
it's 2 types
1.forward proxy:restricts the access in the organisation,
                in this we set the allow and deny rules(accessing the websites)eg:we say as well as apache,like web servers
2.reverse proxy:eg:aache,nginx,etc.,.




putty is what type of client------ssh client,           browser-----http client
lb uses----round robbin algorithm       VIP------MEANS VIRTUAL IP----IF THEY SAY VIP THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT LB'S((we'll install SSL certifaces at lb))
https uses----encrypted algorithm(RSA--algorithm)





how DNS works
=============================
when we searches the website in browser first it'll search at local and in nearest DNS and then it goes to router and searches for the website name,
and it'll checks at name server records,and searches at a records and c records,and finally we'll get the website and it'll displays.

we can check how much fast responding of DNS by this command
dig website name 










recent issues:
=================================
we can enter at admin side but the website is not working because there enduser gateway not working means os has taken reboot temporarly
eg: a=10                 system reboot            gateways are
    echo $a              echo $a                  eth 0---------default gate way
	10                    a                       eth 1, eth 2
	
	route cmd will display which gate way we are entering to the machine
--------route netstat -rn



how we can tell that website is running in cloud or local
==========================================================
nslookup cmd-----------------we can find DNS server also




load balancers
=========================
3 types

1.alb(application)                             2.classic/elastic lb                                    3.nlb(n/w)
we can map multiple applications in alb        it's very cost for multiple websites                     
we add private ips                           
low cost



virtual hosts:
=======================
2 types
1.name based ------1 website and 1 ip
2.ip based--------1 ip and multiple websites



mx-records
=========================
mail exchange


what is the default colum center
=================================
awk

tab----is colum seperator

date | aws '{print $1}'
           '{ptint $c}'
		   
		   
		   
write a script for one person how much time he has logged in
==================================================================




what is subnet mask
======================
A subnet mask is a number that defines a range of IP addresses that can be used in a network.
 A common subnet mask for a Class C IP address is 255.255.255.0.

 
 identify the IPV4
 ======================



i want to track all client ip's wher ever using
=================================================
x forward


with out using edit you want to create a file?
===================================================
echo "hi" >file name
if you want to ovverride use >>




what are the os bootup commands
================================================
fstab------if we attach any volume perminently we need to enter in the fstab otherwise when we reboot the server automatically goes (/etc/fstab)
fdisk-----total info------fdisk -l---------displays disk files



lsblk------------list of partitions 3:1 ratio(3-editable:1-non editable)





how you'll check the password expired or not?
=============================================
chage -l username




difference b/w RDS and EC2
==============================
RDS is a service provided by the aws as a db (DB)---3306                       EC2
no os(no SSH and no RDP)                                                       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, 
public accessessibility info                                                   resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
it's a pass service                                                            EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with
                                                                               minimal friction.

note:    don't compress current day log file if you want to compress first take backup to another path and there 
also it'll occupy the space and then there you can compress the file with gzip
gzip catalina.out.gz
